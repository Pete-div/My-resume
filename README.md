# My-resume
  This is a Application view of my Resume, it has all my details,my work experiences and my Education background, just a click and we are connectted.It has dark and light mode,once you change your phone settings, it will also change also with two languages.
  This app is build with flutter framework and Dart language,when you lunch the app, there is a plashScreen that show my Logo, the first screen shows my face and my Social handles,also, importantly,it shows my profile.You will be required to click on the icoons to get access to more details.The design came as an inspiration on how i can make Resume look more attractive and reactive.I made use of Url-Luncher and GetX package. The Url-luncher help to link my app resume to other browsers on my phone, you dont need to copy my contacts, click on it and it conect you.Also,GetX for route management,very light and powerful frame work.I would hvae loved to add other icons from Svg or make use of my GetX very well if time peermitt.One of the challenges is responsiveness with smaller size phone, availability of power supply and so on.
